	5. Fixed length error of RSN/SSN IE for WpaSupplicant.
	6. Fixed WPAPSK rekey problem when A-MSDU is enabled.
	7. Fixed NetworkManager cannot detect ra0 when ra0 is not up.
	8. Add IEEE802.11d Client Mode: None, Flexible, Strcit.
	9. Add Station N only mode. (Only connects to N-AP)
	10. Add Global country domain(ch1-11:active scan, ch12-14 passive scan)
	11. Enhance PCIe advance power saving
	12. Modified iwpriv ra0 get_site_survey: When security of AP is OPEN/WEP or SHARED/WEP, show UNKNOW/WEP in scan list.
	13. When the secondary channel of AP exceeds the country region's range, station will auto fallback to 20MHz. i.e. need both control and secondary channel are both
	      in country region's channel list.
	14. Fixed crash in LinkDown when there are >64 APs exists.
